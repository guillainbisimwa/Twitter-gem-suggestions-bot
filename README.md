## Built With

## How to run the RSpec test

- You need to have the RSpec installed in you computer if you don't have it follow the steps.

Boot up your terminal and punch in `gem install rspec` to install RSpec. Once that‚Äôs done, you can verify your version of RSpec with rspec --version, which will output the current version of each of the packaged gems.
